# LearnSphere - A MERN Stack Learning Management System

## Project Overview
LearnSphere is a full-fledged Learning Management System (LMS) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This platform will facilitate seamless online learning by allowing instructors to create courses, upload content, and interact with students, while learners can enroll in courses, track their progress, and engage in discussions.

This is my first full MERN stack project, and it will be a great learning experience as I build and deploy a fully functional web application from scratch.
